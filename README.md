# Collection of algorithms and data structures

Collection of common algorithms and data structures implemented in C++/C.
## Running

Every source code is compiled with g++/gcc and warning flags. I'm using C++17, but code should work on C++14.
```bash
$g++ program.cpp -Wall -Wextra
```
Then just run default made executable file, or give a name to executable using -o.
```bash
$./a.out
```
